                    <p class="card-text">He’s single-handedly shifting the meta of this new episode with the suppression mechanic offered by his signature ability, ZERO/POINT. </p>
                    <p>KAY/O has many advantages to offer in a game. He can give utility to his teammates with his suppression and his flash grenades, FLASH/DRIVE, but also sacrifice himself for the greater good thanks to his ultimate, NULL/CMD. This can also allow him to be played as an entry-fragger thanks to the attack boost granted by it and the damage-dealing ability FRAG/MENT. He can basically do everything and there’s no doubt Riot will nerf him in the future. </p>
